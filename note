1. How can I improve my health on my own?

It's not up to your doctor to keep your body in tip-top shape -- it's up to you, with help from your doctor. At your next appointment, discuss with your doctor if there is anything you can do at home to help with your health. 

If you're generally healthy, your doctor will probably recite the basics: Get more sleep, manage stress, eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly. If you have a medical condition, though, your physician may be able to provide specific tips to keep that condition under control. 


2. What should know about this medication?

Your doctor may prescribe a medication if you have a health condition. You deserve to know exactly what you're taking and what it does: The National Institute on Aging recommends asking why this drug was prescribed for you, what it does inside your body, how often and when to take it, and if the drug interacts with any other medications you're currently taking. 

You should also ask about any side effects of the drug and, if you're back for a check-up after taking the medicine for a while, ask if it's working.
